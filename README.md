ReactNative: Native Photo Editor (Android/iOS)

</h1>
This library is a React Native bridge around native photo editor libraries. It allows you to edit any photo by providing below set of features:


* _**Cropping**_
* _**Adding Images -Stickers-**_
* _**Adding Text with Colors**_
* _**Drawing with Colors**_
* _**Scaling and Rotating Objects**_
* _**Deleting Objects**_
* _**Saving to Photos and Sharing**_
* _**Cool Animations**_

## ðŸ“– Getting started

`$ yarn add react-native-photo-editor`

## Publishing

`$ yarn publish`

- **Android**

- Please add below script in your build.gradle

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        ...
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        ...
    }
}
```

- To save image to the public external storage, you must request the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in your manifest file:

`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />`

## ðŸ’» Usage

See Example folder
```
import PhotoEditor from 'react-native-photo-editor'

```

> * Purpose of this library is to edit photos which are within app sandbox, we recommend to move captured image to app sandbox then using RNFS share image path with library for the edit.

> * Example: If we capture image through cameraRoll then we should first move image to app sandbox using RNFS then share app storage path with the editor.

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting
### If using React Native Firebase v6+ or facing any of the following issues: 
  - Add the following to your `podfile -> ios/podfile` and run `pod install`
```
pre_install do |installer|
  installer.pod_targets.each do |pod|
    if pod.name.start_with?('RNFB')
      def pod.build_type;
        Pod::BuildType.static_library
      end
    end
  end
end
```

  - If the above doesn't work, try the following and and re-run `pod install`:

As [@react-native-firebase documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#allow-ios-static-frameworks) you should add following to top of the Podfile for Allow iOS Static Frameworks
```
$RNFirebaseAsStaticFramework = true
```
